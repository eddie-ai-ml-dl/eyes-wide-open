I'm continuing a previous project where we are building a people-counting system using YOLO and OpenCV. The system uses a CurveManager module to handle curve drawing, orientation detection, and region configuration.

Here’s the current state:

- The video is loaded in main.py using:
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture("../data/videos/People Entering And Exiting Mall Stock Footage.mp4")

- We have a working CurveManager class (in modules/curve_manager.py) that:
    • Loads/saves curve configurations (JSON)
    • Allows interactive curve drawing with mouse
    • Supports IN_direction values: "auto", "toward_cam", "away_from_cam", "left", "right"
    • Calls auto_orient_curve from modules/orientation.py to automatically detect curve orientation based on tracked trajectories
    • Stores diagnostics (num_crossings, camera_convention, etc.)
    • Persists orientation results back to the config

- main.py:
    • Loads the curve (or creates it if missing)
    • Runs YOLO tracking on each frame
    • Collects anchors from detected people
    • Uses CurveManager.determine_orientation() to compute orientation once enough samples exist
    • Counts IN/OUT events based on signed distances to the curve

✅ Next step:
Improve and persist orientation diagnostics in `curve_config.json` — meaning:
    • The auto_orient_curve diagnostics (crossings, camera_convention, etc.) should be more detailed and well-structured.
    • CurveManager should save these diagnostics clearly into the config for transparency and debugging.
    • Ensure diagnostics persist and reload correctly when config is reopened.

Please continue from this state and help refine the logic and data structures for diagnostics persistence.
