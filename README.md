# Phase 1
# Project Summary and Setup Instructions: YOLOv12 Person Cropping with Metadata

## Project Objective

The overarching goal of this project is to implement a robust, two-stage image recognition pipeline:
1.  **Stage 1 (Current Focus):** Utilize the Ultralytics YOLOv12 model to detect 'person' objects within images, intelligently crop these detections, and prepare them for a downstream classification task.
2.  **Stage 2 (Future):** Develop and train a custom image classification model to distinguish between 'person with hat' and 'person without hat' using the prepared cropped images.

This document focuses specifically on setting up and executing **Stage 1: Intelligent Cropping and Data Preparation**.
