We’re working on a people-counting system using YOLO and a curve-based IN/OUT detector.
The latest version includes CurveManager for config handling, automatic orientation via auto_orient_curve, and persistence of orientation_diagnostics and camera_orientation in curve_config.json.
We need to improve and validate how diagnostics are recorded, reused, and displayed in both offline tests and main.py.
