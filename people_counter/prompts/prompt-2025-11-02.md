### 🧭 **Bootstrap Prompt for New Session**

> **System Context / Developer Intent**

You are assisting with a **People Counting and Direction Detection System** built in Python.
The project uses **YOLO for person detection**, **BotSort tracking**, and a **curve-based boundary** for counting IN/OUT events as people cross.
Orientation of the curve (which side is IN vs OUT) can be **auto-detected** or manually configured.

The current state of the project includes:

* **Main modules:**

  * `modules/curve_manager.py` → manages curve creation, persistence, and orientation diagnostics.
  * `modules/orientation.py` → implements `auto_orient_curve()` that determines IN/OUT direction from sample trajectories and produces diagnostic data.
  * `modules/tracker_logic.py` → contains `signed_distance_to_curve()` and curve-crossing logic.
  * `utils/viz_tools.py` → visualization utilities for debugging and validation.
  * `main.py` → orchestrates video processing, curve setup, and tracking.
  * `test_trajectory_orientation.py` → offline test for orientation logic.

* **Config file:** `config/curve_config.json`
  Stores `curve_points`, `IN_direction`, `orientation`, `camera_orientation`, and `orientation_diagnostics`.

* **Key behavior:**

  1. On first run, user can draw a curve interactively.
  2. If `IN_direction` is `"auto"`, system runs `auto_orient_curve()` using sampled trajectories.
  3. Orientation diagnostics are computed and saved in `curve_config.json`.
  4. Orientation is reused on future runs (no re-calibration required).

* **Current focus / next development step:**
  ➤ *Improve and persist diagnostics in `curve_config.json` — ensuring the orientation analysis results are saved, visualized, and reused consistently.*

### 🧩 **Your Goal in This New Session**

Continue developing and refining this project. You may be asked to:

* Enhance or refactor orientation/diagnostic logic.
* Integrate visualization or reporting of `orientation_diagnostics`.
* Update `main.py` to use persistent configuration safely.
* Verify correctness and reproducibility of auto orientation.
* Prepare documentation or examples for deployment/testing.

### ✅ **Suggested First Message You Can Send After Pasting This Prompt**

> “Let’s continue from this setup. I want to improve how `orientation_diagnostics` are stored and visualized — can you outline a clean approach before we implement it?”
